•Ensure Virtualization is enabled in CPU processing
•Java file is the brain of XML activity.

•Android is an operating system and programming platform developed by Google for mobile phones and other mobile devices, such as tablets

•The Android platform, based on the Linux kernel, is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets. 
Because Android-powered devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum, providing longer battery use. 

•To develop apps using the SDK, you use the Java programming language to develop the app and Extensible Markup Language (XML) files to describe data resources.

•From the Architecture figure:
	•Apps: Your apps live at this level, along with core system apps for email, SMS messaging, calendars, internet browsing, and contacts.
	•Java API framework : 
	•native libraries written in C and C++ and These native libraries are available to apps through the Java API framework. 
	•Hardware abstraction layer (HAL):This layer provides standard interfaces that expose device hardware capabilities to the higher-level Java API framework
	•Linux kernel: The foundation of the Android platform is the Linux kernel. 

•App components
	•Activities: An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. 
	•Services:A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background.
		for eg It might fetch data over the network without blocking user interaction with an activity.
	•Broadcast receivers:A broadcast receiver is a component that enables broadcasts—
		for example, to let other apps know that some data has been downloaded to the device and is available for them to use
	•Content providers: A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access.
	
The manifest file
	•It is read b4 app runs.
	•Identifies any user permissions the app requires , Declares the minimum API Level required ,
	 Declares hardware and software features used or required by the app, such as a camera,Declares API libraries the app needs to be linked against 
	 and most importantly declaring component.
