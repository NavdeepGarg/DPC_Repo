•JVM : is an abstract machine that provide runtime environment where java bytecode can be executed.
•JRE: is a runtime environment which implements JVM and provide all class libraries and other files that JVM requires at runtime.
•JDK: is tool necessary for compile, document, and package  java programs. 

•Multiprocessing is adding more number of or CPUs/processors to the system which increases the computing speed of the system. 
•Multithreading is allowing a process to create more threads which increase the responsiveness of the system.

MultiProgramming is the strategy of an Operating system that poses importance of Maximum CPU utilization.
	•Max CPU utilization•MultiProgramming means more than one program in main memory
	•Process requires CPU time and I/O time to get completed.When it requires I/O then cPU make a 'context switch' to another process instead of sitting idle.
	•This can be extended to multiple users also. It all depends how fast is your processor is serving the request.
	Disadvantages:
	•Memory scheduling, process scheduling and Paging(Non contiguous memory allocation) all requires.
	
MultiTasking
	•it is a MultiProgramming operating system with time sharing methodology.
	•ONLY ONE CPU but switches so fast that gives an impression/illusion that all processes are running concurrently.

Program 
	•is a set of instruction.
	•It is Passive because Program is stored on disk in some file and does not require any other resources
	•multiple processes can be a part of the same program.
	•Dont get CONFUSE with program and process. when a program comes under execution it become a process.
	
Process
	•When a program is executed, it is known as process.
	•It is Active because Process holds resources such as CPU, memory address, disk, I/O etc.
	•Process : any executing instance of a program on top of your operating system.
For example in a word processor, a background thread may check spelling and grammar while a foreground thread processes user input ( keystrokes ), while yet a third thread loads images from the hard drive, and a fourth does periodic automatic backups of the file being edited.

	
•Synchronization is the process to sync the concurrent thread in execution.
	Program->Process->Thread
	
•System.gc()is the garbage collector destructor call to remove the unused objects.

•Heap is the memory segment where all objects created with 'new' keyword will be stored.
•Stack hold all the references.

•Abstract class object CANNOT BE created by you but CAN BE  created by RunTimeEnvironment.

•Interface object cannot be created neither by you nor by RunTimeEnvironment.

•static block executed when class load where simple block will execute when object created

################SPRING NOTES##########################

•SpringArchitechture Discussed

•It is an application framework and inversion of control container for the java platform.
•It is lightweight and integrated framework that can be used for developing enterprise application.

•For anything if we wish to be available when application is ready use @component annotation, this will tell spring to create an instance of this class.

•By default scope of spring framework is Singleton.

•Other scope is Prototype.

•@autowired is used to create a link with different object that have been created in Spring container.

•FOR spring MVC , src->main->webapp folder must contain all relevant JSP, which will be picked by the application as and when required.

•DispactcherServlet
	•it does the receptionist role for application.
	•It is the front controller in the Spring MVC application as it loads the spring bean configuration file and initialize all the beans that have been configured.
	
•ContextLoaderListner
	the listener to start up and shut down the WebApplication in Spring root.


################SPRING-BOOT NOTES##########################

•artifact Id is project Name •groupID is package name

•thus artifact scope is bigger than group Id

•@SpringBootApplication
this annotation comprises three substructure
	1) @Configuration 2) @componentScan 3) @EnableAutoConfiguration
