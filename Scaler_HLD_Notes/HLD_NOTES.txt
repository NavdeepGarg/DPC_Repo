•Database Types and characteristics
  •RDBMS: for consistency
		PROS: ACID prop, consistency, fixed schema, good for vertical scaling and not for horizontal
		CONS: JOINS becomes complex and adding columns become expensive when datasize grows
           
  •Key-Value Stores : For feature flags, some discoutn values to store e.g REDIS, Memchached etc 
		PROS: fast response
		
  •Document Based Schema: When no fixed schema and heavy read and writes required.
		PROS: highly scalable, sharding support, aggregation queries.

  •Column DBs: nto support ACID transaction , for heavy data or strema data like music player, health tracking data, IoT devices data
		PROS: highly writes,support distibuted DBs.
		
	•Search DBs : full text serach queries, searchign of products, searchign of fligths.
		PROS: they are not primary DB but actually work along with RDBMS in real world application.
  

•Acronym -- ARESM , Availability, Reliability, Efficiency, Scalability, Manageability
Requirement, Back-of-Envelope, API, data model, HLD, Bottlenecks

•Reliability ke liye -- Replica create kardo , because losing a data is not an option
•Availability -- for that create redundant services that can cater the user request , if load rises or failure happen

•Case study of delicious.com is discussed which sclaed from one computer to different server
	•ICANN : The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers-- Non Profit organization
	• DNS server : 
		for eg: Google DNS server is at 8.8.8.8 , 8.8.4.4
		Open DNS : 208.67.222.222
		CloudFare : 1.1.1.1.

•DNS Resolution:
  Find in Browser Cache -> OS Cache ->Resolved Cache(ISP/LEVEL) ->Root Server ->Top Level Domain Server(.com, .co,.gov etc)
  On resolving and coming backward it will be added in cache.

  	•First case of Strong consistency.
	
		   High consistency requirement
		Our system requires strong consistency by default. It is unacceptable for a file to be shown
		differently by different clients at the same time. The system needs to provide strong
		consistency for metadata cache and database layers.
		Memory caches adopt an eventual consistency model by default, which means different
		replicas might have different data. To achieve strong consistency, we must ensure the
		following:
		• Data in cache replicas and the master is consistent.
		• Invalidate caches on database write to ensure cache and database hold the same value.
		Achieving strong consistency in a relational database is easy because it maintains the ACID
		(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties [9]. However, NoSQL databases do
		not support ACID properties by default. ACID properties must be programmatically
		incorporated in synchronization logic. In our design, we choose relational databases because
		the ACID is natively supported.
