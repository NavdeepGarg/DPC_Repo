Software Testing

Verification and Validation Model

This model is used when requirement are well defined and non-ambiguous
Verifications:
	•is the static analysis technique, where testing is done without executing the code
	•e.g. code inspection,code walkthruogh, reviews etc
Validation
	•Dynamic analysis technique, where code is executed by execution
	
	•In this V&V model development and QA activities are done simultaneously and testing starts right from requirement phase.
	 and verification and validation activities go hand in hand.
	•Left hand side are dev act and right side are test act
	•requirement analysis -> UAT
	•Design reviews -> system test plan and traceability matrix  : 
	•Architecture diagram is created , their modules and dependencies ->INtegraation test plan 
	•Low level design for function and interfaces are defines-> Unit case testing 
	
	•Unit testing is done to check the desired output of the function written, this is been done majorly by dev team.
	 bugs are logged and tracked.
	•Integartion test plan produces integration test cases and track them 
	

Software Testing Life Cycle:
	
	•It is software testing process tat executed in planned and systematic manner to improve the quality of product.
	 that identifies what test activities to carry out and when to accomplish those test activities.
	•RA:QA team figure out the testable requirements. they follow up with stakeholders like Architecture designer, business analyst to get answer for any question.
		
	•Test Planning: Important phase where test manager figure the cost and effort to be done for commencing the testing.
	•Test Case DEvelopment:	Testing team wrte test case and gather required data and get reviewd by QA lead.
							Requirement tracebility matrix is built where each test cases is mapped with the corresponding requirement.
	•Enviromnet Setup : it is an independent activity where testing environment is sets up.
	•Test Execution  : Test case execution started.
	•Test Cycle closure: 

Types of Testing
	•Manual Testign and Automation Testing:
	Challenges with Maual Testing are  : Boring, Error prone, Time consuming, Tedious.

Static Methods of testing are : code inspection , code review 

Testing Methods(dynamic methods):
	•Black Box Testing:Known as Behavioural Testign , s/w test the interanl structual, design and implementation and UI and UX of the product being tested.
	•White Box : 	internal structure , login design and implementation of different module.
	•Grey bOx:Only Partly internal sturcure is known to the tester.

Fucntional Testing
	•Describe what the product does
	•Unit testing, Acceptance trsting,Smoke Testing,Integration Teasting,Rehression testing
Non Functional Testing:
	•Performed after Functional Testing
	•Describe how prodyct works
	•Performance Tsting,Scalability Trsting,Load Trsting, Stress Testing
	
Software Testign Level
	•Unit->Integration->System->Accpetance

Software Testing Document and its aritfacts:
	•Test Plan: Provide Outline strategy which will be implemented for testing the application.
	•Test Scenario:a single line stmt that notifies the area in which your app will experiment.
	•Test Case: collections of  steps , conitions , inputs and expected outputs which can be implemnetedd
	•Tracebility Matrix: that map requirement at SDLC with test cases
