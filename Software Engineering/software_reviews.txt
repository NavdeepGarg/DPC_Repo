•software problems. One is bugs, which are implementation problems. The other is software flaws—architectural
	problems in the design. People pay too much attention to bugs and not enough on flaws

•the TR is an effective means for uncovering errors and improving software quality.
•defect and fault are synonymous
•defect : imply a quality problem that is discovered after the software has been released to end users.
•error to depict a quality problem that is discovered by software engineers (or others) before the software is released to the end user.

•Review effort =Preparation Effort + Assessment Effort + Rework Effort

•The objectives of an FTR are: 
	(1) to uncover errors in function, logic, or implementation for any representation of the software; 
	(2) to verify that the software under review meets its requirements; 
	(3) to ensure that the software has been represented according to predefined standards.

•The FTR is actually a class of reviews that includes walk-through and inspections.

•Software reliability is defined in statistical terms as “the probability of failure-free operation of a computer program in a specified environment for a specified time”
	•measure of reliability
	 meantime-between-failure (MTBF): MTTF(mean-time-to-failure) + MTTR(mean-time-to-repair)
	•
•Software availability is the probability that a program is operating according to requirements at a given point in time and is defined as
	availability=100*MTTF/(MTTF+MTTR)
	
The specific goals of a walk-through are:-
	• to present the document to stakeholders both within and outside the software discipline, in order to gather information regarding the topic under documentation.
	• to explain and evaluate the contents of the document.
	• to establish a common understanding of the document.
	• to examine and discuss the validity of proposed solutions and the possible alternatives.

The specific goals of a technical review are:
	• evaluate the value of technical concepts and alternatives in the product and project environment.
	• establish consistency in the use and representation of technical concepts.
	• ensuring at an early stage, that technical concepts are used correctly;
	• inform participants of the technical content of the document.
	
The specific goals of a Inspection are:
	• help the author to improve the quality of the document under inspection.
	• remove defects efficiently, as early as possible.
	• improve product quality, by producing documents with a higher level of quality.
	• create a common understanding by exchanging information among the inspection participants.
