Cloud computing
	•It is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via internet with pay as go pricing
	•E.g. DropBox , google Photos
	•Instead of buying you can use services provided by others like AWS
	•It help in reducing the overall cost.
	•Services ranges from infrastructure to data storage and computing to machine learning
	
Services:
	SaAS:
		•Software as Services
		•Cloud provider lease their software to client E.g. Sale-forces for providing customer relations manager on cloud infrastructure.
	PaaS
		•Platform as services
		•it gives the ability to th customer to deploy customer developed apps using prog. languages , tools etc that are provided by Cloud provider. E.g. GoogleApp Engine
	IaaS
		•Infrastructure as Services
		•Provide virtualized computing resources over the internet.

Cloud Type
	Public : anyone can use
	Private : authentication is required and will be given some private space
	Hybrid: If your private space has gone more congested then you can use the public space as well.

IoT
	•InternetOfThing , set of connected devices
	•It enables the connected devices to communicate with each other. The various sensors used in the devices keep on posting its data on IoT server.
	•IoT server integrate the data , analyze the data and shared with other devices for better user experience and automation.
	
	•Eg. AC manufacturing machine have sensor that keep on reporting its health to the mobile devices and further the barcode machine where sensor again to sen the details to mobile devices
	Thus in effect every parcel can be mapped easily on the mobile itself.

1EXAbyte = 1000petaByte=1000000TeraByte=1000000000gigaByte

•Definition
	Big Data is also data but with a huge size. Big Data is a term used to describe a collection of data that is huge in volume and yet growing exponentially with time
	Thus it becomes quite evident to process this data.

•5V'
	Volume, Velocity,Variety, Veracity(Accuracy), Value

•Hadoop, Cassandra, Spark are the framwerok to process Bigdata
	HDFS(Hadoop ditributed file system) does not perform parallel processing as it is the work of MapReduce. HDFS is the storage layer of Hadoop that stores smaller chunks of data on multiple data nodes in a distributed manner.
