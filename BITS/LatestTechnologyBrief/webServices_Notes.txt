	•Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) is a component of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from other network application architectures. With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia.
	•Hypermedia : an extension to hypertext providing multimedia facilities, such as those handling sound and video.

#################Web Service##############

	•Definition : Software system designed to support inter-operable machine to machine interaction over a network
	•SOAP
		•Simple object access protocol, anyways it is no longer an abbreviation anymore.It is just like request response now.
		•Its structure includes : SOAP envelop, SOaP Header (include meta Info like authorization , IT IS OPTIONAL), SOAP Body (contains actual request response)
		•ALWAYS it is SOAP XML
		•WSDL : Web Service Definition Language: 
			•Service Provider publishes an interfcae for its service that describe all functionality of webservice.This XML based interfcae is WSDL.
			•EndPoint -where the service is exposed at.
			•All Operations: contains Operations which are allowed, CRUD
			•
		•UDDI : Universal Description Discovery INtegration , is an online directory from where a consumer will search the required wsdl file of 
				service provider.
	
	•REST
		•It is built over HTTP protocol to transfer the data between client and server.
		•Both XML and JSON can be used for data transfer
		•It does not have any definition language
		
		
		
#################Spring Cloud##############

The image which is saved 'centralized_SpringCLoudConfigServer.png' so far tutorial is trying to extract the configuration properties for microservices from a local git repo through a spring_cloud_configserver.

	•Config-Client 
		•dependencies are Web, DevTools,Actuator, ConfigClient .Example : limits-service
		#####STEPS:
		•Change the application.properties to bootstrap.properties
		•add the uri of spring cloud server in bootstrap.properties
		•commit the configurations files in CENTRAL git-repository
		
		
	•Config-Server : 
		•dependencies are simply DevTools and ConfigServer . Example : spring-cloud-config-server URL : https//localhost:8888/limits-service/qa
		•spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri is the important param through which git repo is accessed and returning the configuration properties of other servcies e.g. limits-service
		•
	
	•FEING
		•It is one of the component Spring CLoud inherit from Netflix
		•It is used to talk to other MicroService
		•Step 1: @EnableFeignClient
		•Step 2:Make the interface-proxy (FeignClient) of the desired micro service with which to start the communication.
		
		
	RunConfiguartion in eclipse made into use to run a new instances of same application on different port number <IMP>
	
	•RIBBON
		•It is the component to share the load between different instances of same application running on different ports number
		•currency-exchange-service.ribbon.listOfServers=http://localhost:8000,http://localhost:8001 entry to be made in application.properties of on Requesting microservice.
		(who will going to make request to another servcice)
		•@RibbonClient(name="currency-exchange-service") annotation to be used on Requesting microservice(who will going to make request to another servcice)

	•EUREKA
		•is the naming server, that offers  service-registration and service-discovery 
		
	•ZUUL
		•API gateways for authorization, security, authenticztion, ratelimits,fault tolerance.
		
	•ZIPKIN
		•Used for Distributed tracing, to know what and how call to microservoces are going
