•In simpler terms, Machine learning is an sub-domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It relies on underlying hypothesis of creating the model and tries to improve it by fitting more data into the model over time.
•A machine is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

•Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

•The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.

Eg of AI :play chess and self-driving cars ,Speech recognition
Eg of ML : Email Spam and Malware Filtering,Paypal is using ML for protection against money laundering

•Inductive learnign  when father ask children not to play with fire it will burn you.
•Dedductive Learnign : When father let the child to paly with fire to let him conclude that fire can burn him.

Reinforcement learning 
	•is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. In reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence faces a game-like situation. The computer employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem. To get the machine to do what the programmer wants, the artificial intelligence gets either rewards or penalties for the actions it performs. Its goal is to maximize the total reward.
	Although the designer sets the reward policy–that is, the rules of the game–he gives the model no hints or suggestions for how to solve the game. It’s up to the model to figure out how to perform the task to maximize the reward, starting from totally random trials and finishing with sophisticated tactics and superhuman skills. By leveraging the power of search and many trials, reinforcement learning is currently the most effective way to hint machine’s creativity. In contrast to human beings, artificial intelligence can gather experience from thousands of parallel gameplays if a reinforcement learning algorithm is run on a sufficiently powerful computer infrastructure.
	•The main challenge in reinforcement learning lays in preparing the simulation environment, which is highly dependant on the task to be performed.
