Data Redundancy
	•When multiple time data is repeated for no effective reason.(e.g. Student and Branch storage)
	•It leads to data inconsistency and following anomalies:
	•Insertion Ano.: when you cannot a piece of data because other part of the tuple is not available
	•Update Ano. : when you have to update a single piece of data , but it has to update in all tables.
	•Delete Ano : whne u want to delete unwanted data but it may alos delete data which you dont want to delete.

•To tackle data redundancy Normalization has come into effect.
