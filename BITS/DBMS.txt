Data
	•Fact recorded are known as Data
DataBase
	•Collection of related Data e.g. MulltipmediaDatabase, DataWarehouse, Relational DB.
	Relational Database, Operational Database,Data Warehouse,Distributed Database,End-user Database(this is a shared database which is specifically designed for the end user, just like different levels’ managers) - SRC QUORA
	
DBMS
	•DBMS = Database + Management System
	•DBMS is a collection of inter-related data and set of programs to store & access those data in an easy and effective manner
	•A database management system (DBMS) is a software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database

Data Redundancy
	•When multiple time data is repeated for no effective reason.(e.g. Student and Branch storage)
	•It leads to data inconsistency and following anomalies:
	•Insertion Ano.: when you cannot insert a piece of data because other part of the tuple is not available
	•Update Ano. : when you have to update a single piece of data , but it has to update in all tables.
	•Delete Ano : whne u want to delete unwanted data but it may alos delete data which you dont want to delete.

•To tackle data redundancy Normalization has come into effect.

•B and b+ tree are multilevel dynamic indexing structures
	•B+ is better 

•Entity–relationship model (ER model) 
	are non-technical diagramm that describes the structure of a database with the help of a diagram, which is known as Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram). 
	it is a conceptual diagram that works on perception of real world.
	
Weak Entity:
An entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes and relies on the relationship with other entity is called weak entity. The weak entity is represented by a double rectangle. For example – a bank account cannot be uniquely identified without knowing the bank to which the account belongs, so bank account is a weak entity.
	
 Er to Database tables
	Imp facts:
	•Table for Weak entity is required
	•Table for M*N relationsip is alos required.

•Transaction are the set of related operations
	•ACID property.
	•I : ISOLAtion is managed by concurrency control management
	•D : Durability is managed by Recovery management system
	•C :Consistency is ensured if rest three are in place.

Concurrency issues

	•Dirty read: reading  value from a uncomitted transaction
		•Solution:Commit after other transaction get committed.
	•Unrepeatable Read-- variable updated by other transaction
	•Phantom Read -- variable deleted by other transaction
	•Lost Update -- write write conflict
