•index.html--> index.js-->App.js //flow of react app

•JSX convention says , enclosed all HTML element in div tag

•{logo} braces means it is javascript variable

•Two types of component
 •Class based component
 •Function based component
 
•Class based component
   •has lifecycle methods
   •has state to be stored which is not applicable for function based component
   •has constructor
   •has render function which is not applicable for function based component
 
•moving ahead with Function based component
	<>
     <h3>My app</h3>
     <p>My app works</p>
     </>
	 •Wrapping your code in angular bracket is the mandatory requirement 
	 

 
•props are the javascript object which is used to pass parameters from parent component to child component
	props object has history property default

•Closing of element is utmost required

•npm install bootstrap@latest --save
	npm install react-code-snippet --save
	npm install axios --save
	npm install react-router-dom --save
	
•state is applicable for class Components 

•flow is : constructor()-> render()- > componentDidMount() and cycle in componentDidMount() with render()

•Use props in functional and class component to pass data from one page to another page


•onClick={this.testfunc().bind(this)} OR ()=>this.testfunc() (arrow function) are the common ways to bind the function in class based component
	•To avoid explicit binding we use arrow function


•onClick={testfun} OR ()=>this.testfunc() are the common ways to bind the function in function based component

•componentDidMount() is called when the class component is completely ready, therefore it is advisable to call for api in componentDidMount only.

•componentDidUpdate() is called whenever setState is called.

•[] square bracket can be termed as searching operator because they will search for the value of the literal passing inside it.

•Basically the curly braces {} are the another way for creating objects in javascript. This is equivalent to the "new Object()" syntax.
	var x = {'float': 'right'}
	is the nicer/shorter form of 
	var x = new Object(); x.float = 'right';
