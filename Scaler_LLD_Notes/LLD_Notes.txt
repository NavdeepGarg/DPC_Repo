-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Classs 1:--
What is LLD
	•Low-level design 
	•Low level Implementation details of software
	•Orgnization of Code
	•Writing the software which are good
	
	Principles of Good Software
	•Code Reusability
		1)Tightly Coupling is the fist thing to avoid completely.
		2) No Hardocoding of values, always pass as a param.
	•Extensibility
		1)To enable/cater any furture requirements.
		2) TO change the platform.

Classes
	•Blueprint of an entity

Interface
	•Blueprint of a behavior , OR a contract
	•means, everyone who implements me, must develop my behavior

When we override the method of parent class in child classes, then for that child class the behvaiour will get inline with the child class implementation.

Class is the buleprint of the rral world object ... and we shall add behaviour to a class using interfcaes(has-A relation)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Classs 2:

•OOP has three pillars : Poly, Inheritance , Encapsulation
Abstraction
	•It is basically a representation of Idea
	•It represents all details of an entity in a given context for a particualr system.
	•Omit the non-needed details
	•Example functionality in various available APIs.

Encapsulation
	•It hides the data and it holds the data.
	•Access modifiers provides the encapsulation

Inheritance
	•IS-A relationship
	•provides extensibility i.e. adding new things, modifying is the not the part of extensibility
	•it is recommended to use inheritance when we are extendign the physical attribute.
	
<<IMP>>•But when it is about behavior then we shall go for "Interface" and make that behaviour as an Interface which shall be implemented
	by few implementing classes. Those implemented classes(behaviour) can then be injected in our concrete class.
		E.g. Animal <- Dog , IWalkingBehavour <<Implements by >> FastWalkingBehaviour
		then Dog extends Animal(to attain physical attributes) and we can inject the behavioural classes seperately.
		class Dog extends Animal{
		IWalkingBehavour walkBehaviour;
		
		//Stub 
		}
			

Polymorphosism
	•

Composition
	•Has-A relationship

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Classs 3:	

•SingleTon discussed.

•Enum are classes with only particular set of values.
		eg
		enum Color{
			RED=1,
			BLUE=2}
		enum Direction{
			NORTH=1,
			SOUTH=2,EAST=3,WEST=4}
	•In Java enums are classes , and thus enum can have methods and properties as well.
	
	 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

class 4:
•Entity classes are classes and dotn add any behaviour related information to it.
•Add behaviour in Interfaces only.
Creational Pattern:
 Factory Mehtod
 
 An abstratc class is chosen when object of the class doesn't make sense at present
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Classs Structural Design Patterns:
	•adpaterpattern discussed
	
	•FlyDesign Pattern
		•whenever you see alot of instances and that have two type of prop intrinsic and extrinsic, consider the class divide into typw of class One with intrinsic and other with extrinsic. and make intrinsic immutable
		•This help in saving lot of memory
		
	•Decorator Pattern
		•Have a particular entity and have multiple layers that can be added.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•Expectation in LLD :
	1)Structure the problem.
	2)Define entities, Define relationship , Define Class diagram
	3)Try implementing the SOLID principle.
	  
	-----
	1)Clarification and requirement elicitation is utmost required. Discuss the requirements
	2)keep Scalability in mind.
	
	-----
	
	PEN example
		•Ask everything and dont assume.
		Q1) What is the high level Requirement;
		Q2) Future Scope.
		
		Requirement:
		•Design a pen with write functionality
		•Anything with a nib , body and write in ink is a pen
		•Ball point pen and ink pen and both should write in diff way		
		•Future-- pen with refill fucntionality
		
		Class Diagram:
		Identify Entity
		1)	•Nouns in the Requirement.
			•Pen , Ink , Nib, Marker Pen, Body
		2) •Intitutive approach / visualization

Snake and Ladder Design Example
	•Ask What is X
	•CurrentRequirement and Future Requirement and Behaviour because these three requirement willl serve the base for our design
