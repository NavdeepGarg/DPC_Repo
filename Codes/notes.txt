•constraints will help in knowing the data type required.
• the max value of the constraints helps in deciding the approach of Time complexity of the algorithm.
	e.g. 1<N<10^18    then our TC should always be O(logn) to satisfy the constraints

	
•WRiTE FOR BIN SEARCH, DFS, BFS,  cumulative sum

•Scope of Improvement 
	•Any repetitive work.
	•Any repetetive work.

•Sliding  Window
	•Variable window size , Fixed Window size
	

•Graph
