Digital Signature
	•Non Repudiation, authentication, Integrity(Msg is not altered in between)
	
Hash Algorithm
	•One way only, not reverse.
	•Output is called as digest
	•Digest can be reversed to plain text if the original message/password is weak	(password hacking)

Dictionary Attack
	•Look up of pre-stored digest and plain text is created , and hacker will then search the stolen digest in that dictionary.
	
BruteForce Attack
	•by guessing and chances
	
Private Key Encryption
	•single key shared between Sender and Receiver
	•Two types-stream Cipher, Block cipher
	•stream cipher does bit by bit encryption (e.g. Rivest Cipher 4), block does block by block.(e.g. Rivest Cipher 5, DES)

Public Key Encryption
	•communication has to start with receiver first, bcos he will generate the key pair that would be used by the sender to encrypt the message .
	•Receiver will use the private key to decrypt the message.
	•One flaw is receiver may not know if the message is sent by the right sender or man in middle has come.

Circuit Switching
	•Dedicated circuit established for communication between the system
	•Ideal for telephone services which happen on real time basis.
	•It rent the circuit or path till the communication get ends, thats why International call are expensive

Packet Switching
	•ideal case for where small lag or delay is acceptable.
	•Internet is based on packet switching where data packet are traveling with a IP address and sequencing mechanism.

An intranet is private network which are heavily protected by networking devices.

IDS : intrusion Detection System , IPS:Intrusion Prevention system -> they both can be part of a single instrument also.
	Its job is to detect , log, prevent the unwanted traffic and data coming to INTERNET.

Salt is the random number generated for each user password which is then mixed up with the digest in order to make it more difficult password for the user.
Salt is stored in DB as well
where as Pepper is another secret not-necessarily unique number which can be added to salt in min order to make it more difficult password for the user.
Pepper is not stored in DB

•VPN
VPNs essentially create a data tunnel between your local network and an exit node in another location, which could be thousands of miles away, making it seem as if you’re in another place. This benefit allows online freedom, or the ability to access your favorite apps and websites while on the go.

Here’s a closer look at how a virtual private network works. VPNs use encryption to scramble data when it’s sent over a Wi-Fi network. Encryption makes the data unreadable. Data security is especially important when using a public Wi-Fi network, because it prevents anyone else on the network from eavesdropping on your internet activity.

There’s another side to privacy. Without a VPN, your internet service provider can know your entire browsing history. With a VPN, your search history is hidden. That’s because your web activity will be associated with the VPN server’s IP address, not yours. A VPN service provider may have servers all over the world. That means your search activity could appear to originate at any one of them. Keep in mind, search engines also track your search history, but they’ll associate that information with an IP address that’s not yours. Again, your VPN will keep your online activity private.
