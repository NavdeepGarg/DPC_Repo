System Testing :StaticTesting and Vulnerability scanning by SonarCube and Coverity-(Non Functional testing)

Developers describe Coverity Scan as "Find and fix defects in your Java, C/C++ or C# open source project for free". Coverity's implementation of static analysis can follow all the possible paths of execution through source code (including interprocedurally) and find defects and vulnerabilities caused by the conjunction of statements that are not errors independent of each other. On the other hand, SonarQube is detailed as "Continuous Code Quality". SonarQube provides an overview of the overall health of your source code and even more importantly, it highlights issues found on new code. With a Quality Gate set on your project, you will simply fix the Leak and start mechanically improving.

Coverity Scan and SonarQube can be categorized as "Code Review" tools.


The static code analysis has been performed manually and then by using Coverity and SonarQube tools in default code rule settings.
